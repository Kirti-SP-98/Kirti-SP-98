ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kirti, an aspiring full-stack developer on a journey to master React, Node.js, Angular, .NET and many more.

ðŸš€ I'm deeply passionate about crafting innovative web applications that make a positive impact. Currently, I'm diving deep into the realms of frontend development with React, exploring its powerful capabilities to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

ðŸ’» Simultaneously, I'm delving into backend development with Node.js, harnessing its event-driven architecture to build scalable and efficient server-side applications. Additionally, I'm eager to explore Angular's structured approach to frontend development and .NET's robust framework for backend solutions.

ðŸŒŸ With a thirst for knowledge and a drive for excellence, I'm committed to mastering these technologies and honing my skills as a versatile full-stack developer.

ðŸ”§ Alongside React, Node.js, Angular, and .NET, I'm also familiarizing myself with a range of complementary technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and SQL, among others.
